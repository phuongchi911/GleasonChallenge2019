Background
Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the sixth most common and second deadliest cancer among men worldwide. There exist various techniques for PCa detection and staging. However, microscopic inspection of stained biopsy tissue by expert pathologists is the most accurate method. Based on the observable histological patterns, each region of the tissue is assigned a Gleason grade of 1 to 5. The final Gleason score is reported as the sum of the most prominent and second most prominent patterns; e.g., a tissue with the most prominent pattern of Gleason grade of 4 and the second most prominent pattern of Gleason grade of 3 will have a Gleason score of 4+3.

This challenge aims at the automatic Gleason grading of prostate cancer from H&E-stained histopathology images. This task is of critical importance because Gleason score is a strong prognostic predictor. On the other hand, it is very challenging because of the large degree of heterogeneity in the cellular and glandular patterns associated with each Gleason grade, leading to significant inter-observer variability, even among expert pathologists.

Gleason grading of prostate cancer is usually performed via visual inspection (with a microscope) of the prostate tissue by expert pathologists. However, this is a time-consuming task and suffers from very high inter-observer variability. Automatic computer-aided methods have the potential for improving the speed, accuracy, and reproducibility of the results.


Data
Data used in this challenge consists of a set of tissue micro-array (TMA) images. Each TMA image is annotated in detail by several expert pathologists.
